# ULostIFound

HackUMass 2022 Project

A web application for UMass Students to register items as either lost or found. If a person finds they are missing something, they can mark the item as lost and a building they believe they might have lost it in. Other students can see lost items and be on the lookout or mark random items they find around as found. On the homepage, there is a large interactive map that students can use to quickly find locations around campus. If they do not want to use the map, they can go to the 'I found' or 'I lost' button and submit an item with a drop down menu for locations. Another button on the nav bar is the 'Lost N Found' button which takes you to the table that shows all items that are either lost or found and can be filtered and searched.

The app uses React, Javascript, and MongoDB to get the data and represent the data in the form of a table and map. It uses axios calls to access the database for each page.
